/**
 * Builds and manages the floating volume panel. The look comes entirely from the user-selected
 * [OverlaySkin] (via [OverlayPrefs] → [styleFor]).
 *
 * Two families of layout exist:
 * - The generic list renderer (Android 7–8): a single styled container of sliders. It's expandable —
 *   both versions collapse to just the Media row (it's what the hardware volume keys drive) and
 *   expand to add Ring and Alarm — plus one slider per currently-playing non-system app. Android 8's
 *   expanded order is Media / Ring / Alarm, so Media's own chevron carries the toggle; Android 7's
 *   expanded order is Ring / Media / Alarm (icon-only rows, no labels), so its toggle instead lives
 *   in [GenericChevronToggle], floating over the trailing space every row already reserves for a
 *   chevron rather than sitting in any one row, so it never moves and adds no extra height. The Ring
 *   row drives Notification too (merged streams), and while the ring is muted it greys out behind an
 *   "Alarms only" footer.
 * - Android 9–11: a bespoke two-state layout — a right-edge collapsed panel (ringer button +
 *   vertical media slider + tune footer) that expands into a bottom "Sound" sheet with every stream,
 *   per-app sliders, and SEE MORE / DONE.
 *
 * Owned by [com.volume_plus_plus.app.service.VolumeKeyService], which runs in the app process so
 * this can call [PrivilegedManager] directly.
 *
 * Per-app slider levels are read from and written back through [appVolume], which persists each
 * app's chosen volume for the lifetime of its playback session and re-applies it as players churn —
 * so a level survives screen off/on and other transient interruptions instead of resetting to full.

     * [AudioManager.setRingerMode] is the framework's *external* ringer path, and its zen helper
     * switches Do Not Disturb on ("Alarms only") whenever an app asks that way for silent while zen
     * is off — that, not this app, is what used to enable DND here (it's unconditional in
     * ZenModeHelper on Android 9–15, which is why the panel could never opt out of it). The internal
     * setter has no such link, but it's behind `enforceVolumeController`, so only the system volume
     * panel may call it directly. Hence two routes, best first:
     *
     *  1. **The privileged service.** `cmd audio set-ringer-mode SILENT` lands on that internal
     *     setter, so it selects real silent and leaves zen exactly where it was. It runs in the
     *     Shizuku process, so it needs Shizuku connected and a platform new enough to carry the
     *     sub-command — hence the fallback below when it isn't available.
     *  2. **The volume-key path**, which any app may use: mute the ring stream, dropping the ringer
     *     to vibrate (straight to silent where there's no vibrator), then step down once more to try
     *     for silent. Muting first also clears what would otherwise block that step — the platform
     *     ignores a "lower" that repeats the previous direction, and debounces one arriving just
     *     after a lower that itself dropped normal → vibrate; a mute is neither, so the two run
     *     back-to-back with nothing to wait for. FLAG_ALLOW_RINGER_MODES asks for the ringer-mode
     *     step explicitly, so this keeps working on builds where ring isn't the stream carrying the
     *     ringer modes (Android 15's split ring/notification volumes).
     *
     * **Route 2 usually stops at vibrate, and that's a permission, not a race.** AudioService's
     * `checkForRingerModeChange` only converts vibrate → silent when its
     * `VolumePolicy.volumeDownToEnterSilent` is set, and SystemUI — the only caller allowed to set
     * that policy — has left it off since Oreo (the same reason the hardware keys can't reach silent
     * on stock Android either). So on a phone with a vibrator the mute is as far as it goes. The
     * ring is muted either way, and the panel then repaints from the real mode, showing vibrate —
     * what the device is genuinely in — rather than a silent it isn't. Turning DND on to force the
     * point is deliberately not an option here, with or without a fallback.
